# ITians Website

Visit the site [here](https://itians.xyz).

This is our class website which we use to see our timetable and post notes. PLease feel free to fork this repository, open issues, and submit pull requests.

## Understanding the code

This site uses [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com)

For now, the code is pretty simple and has been commented. It is a nice place to start for absolute beginners. Still if you feel lost, contact [here](http://github.com/lakshay365).

## In case of any problem

Create an issue. I'll be very happy to resolve them.
